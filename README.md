# Regression-Analysis-on-Physicochemical-properties-of-Protein-Tertiary-Structure
This repository contains an analytical study on Physicochemical properties of protein Tertiary Structure based on Multiple Linear Regression. In this study, Multicollinearity checking diagnostics and Variable selection method has been employed to observe which of the factors mostly affect the Root Mean Squared Distance (RMSD) of protein structure or RMSD value.
